## 🧠 What is The 2nd Blog?

A digital garden and knowledge base, serving as my personal second brain. It grows as I learn, think, and write.

- **Topics are organized by folders:**
  - [`2nd opinion`](./2nd%20opinion/) — My takes, reflections, and commentary
  - [`Research`](./Research/) — Notes, summaries, and deep dives into various subjects

- **Tags** help you find related posts and connect ideas. Look for tags at the bottom of each note.

- **Multilingual:**
  - Most content is in English, but some posts are also available in 中文（Chinese）.
  - Use the language switcher (coming soon) or look for language tags in posts.
