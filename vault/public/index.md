# Welcome to My Digital Garden

This is a test page for my Quartz-powered digital garden. Here I'll share my thoughts, notes, and ideas.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organized by their publication date. It's a place where I can share my thoughts and notes in public.

## Topics I'm Interested In

- Technology
- Programming
- Personal Knowledge Management
- Learning in public

Feel free to explore the links and connections between my notes!
